# VERIFY 3: Python Orchestrator Works with status-cli.js

## Summary

**Status: PASSED**

The Python orchestrator (`plan_orchestrator.py`) successfully works with `status-cli.js` for all queries after the deletion of `plan-orchestrator.js`.

## Commands Verified

| Command | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `status` | ✓ PASS | Returns plan status with planPath, percentage, total, completed |
| `next N` | ✓ PASS | Returns next N recommended tasks with priority ordering |
| `phases` | ✓ PASS | Returns all phases with completion percentages |
| `check TASK_ID` | ✓ PASS | Returns task info with canStart and blockers |
| `retryable` | ✓ PASS | Returns failed tasks eligible for retry |
| `detect-stuck` | ✓ PASS | Detects tasks stuck in_progress too long |
| `progress` | ✓ PASS | Shows formatted progress bar |

## Python Integration Tests

All `PlanOrchestrator` class methods work correctly:

```
get_status(): PASS
  - percentage: 35%
  - total: 68
  - completed: 24
get_next_tasks(5): PASS
  - count: 1
get_retryable_tasks(): PASS
  - count: 0

✓ All Python orchestrator methods verified with status-cli.js!
```

## Changes Made in Phase 3

1. **Task 3.1-3.4**: Added `status`, `next`, `phases`, `check` commands to `status-cli.js`
2. **Task 3.5**: Updated `plan_orchestrator.py` to use `status-cli.js` instead of `plan-orchestrator.js`
3. **Task 3.6**: Deleted `plan-orchestrator.js` and related test files

## Files Affected

- Deleted: `scripts/plan-orchestrator.js`
- Deleted: `scripts/tests/test-plan-orchestrator.js`
- Deleted: `scripts/tests/test-plan-runner-sh.js`
- Updated: `scripts/tests/run-all-tests.js` (removed deleted test references)
- Updated: `.claude/commands/plan/orchestrate.md` (now uses status-cli.js)

## Conclusion

Phase 3 is complete. The orchestrator architecture has been simplified:

**Before:**
```
plan_orchestrator.py → plan-runner.sh → plan-orchestrator.js → status-cli.js
```

**After:**
```
plan_orchestrator.py → status-cli.js
```

This eliminates 2 files (~600 lines) and reduces the call chain significantly.
