## Migration Verification Results

### Test 1: Migration Script
- Command: `node scripts/migrate-completed-plan.js "docs/completed plans/claude-commands-enhancement.md"`
- Result: ✓ Successfully created docs/plan-outputs/claude-commands-enhancement/
- status.json: 51 tasks, all marked completed with `migrated: true`
- Output structure: status.json, findings/, timestamps/

### Test 2: Fallback Logic
- Plan WITH status.json: Source = 'status.json', 51 tasks
- Plan WITHOUT status.json: Source = 'markdown', 32 tasks (parsed from checkboxes)

### Conclusion
Migration and backwards compatibility work correctly.
