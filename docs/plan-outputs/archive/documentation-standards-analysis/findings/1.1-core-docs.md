# Core Documentation Assessment

## Overview

Assessed 4 core documentation files in `docs/`:

| File | Lines | Last Updated | Status |
|------|-------|--------------|--------|
| VISION.md | 165 | Active | KEEP |
| ARCHITECTURE.md | 194 | Active | KEEP |
| ORCHESTRATOR.md | 424 | Active | KEEP |
| PLAN-EXECUTION-TRACKER.md | 199 | 2025-12-24 | CONSOLIDATE |

## File-by-File Assessment

### 1. VISION.md

**Purpose:** Defines the philosophical direction and high-level design of the dev_workflow system. Establishes the "Analyze → Implement → Verify" pattern and catalogs planned commands.

**Content Summary:**
- Philosophy statement about AI-powered development
- Command category taxonomy (Discovery, Design, Quality, Implementation, Documentation)
- Workflow examples for common scenarios
- Key design decisions (command boundaries, artifact flow, progressive depth)
- Success metrics and next steps

**Relevance Assessment:**
- Actively referenced for understanding system direction
- Contains valid taxonomies that guide implementation priorities
- Lists P0/P1/P2 command priorities

**Recommendation:** **KEEP** (essential)
- This is the strategic vision document
- Should be updated to reflect actual implementation progress
- References archived implementation plans correctly

---

### 2. ARCHITECTURE.md

**Purpose:** Technical reference documenting the current system architecture, components, and data flow.

**Content Summary:**
- System architecture diagram (plan_orchestrator.py → status-cli.js → plan-status.js)
- Core components breakdown (Plan System, Claude Commands, Scripts, Libraries)
- Directory structure reference
- Workflow documentation
- Key design decisions (status.json as source of truth, derived path resolution, atomic writes)

**Relevance Assessment:**
- Accurately describes current implementation
- Essential for understanding component relationships
- Referenced by developers and agents for system context

**Recommendation:** **KEEP** (essential)
- Authoritative technical architecture reference
- Should be kept in sync with actual implementation
- Well-structured and accurate as of current codebase

---

### 3. ORCHESTRATOR.md

**Purpose:** Comprehensive documentation for the Plan Orchestrator system including status CLI commands, status.json format, and troubleshooting.

**Content Summary:**
- Architecture diagram for orchestrator flow
- Complete status-cli.js command reference
- status.json schema and field documentation
- Source of truth explanation (markdown vs status.json)
- Troubleshooting guide with common issues
- Configuration reference

**Relevance Assessment:**
- Essential for using the orchestrator system
- Contains detailed command examples
- Troubleshooting section actively useful

**Recommendation:** **KEEP** (essential)
- Primary reference for orchestrator usage
- Most comprehensive CLI documentation
- Contains unique troubleshooting content

---

### 4. PLAN-EXECUTION-TRACKER.md

**Purpose:** Tracks overall execution status across all plans with progress percentages and execution order.

**Content Summary:**
- Active plan status table
- Phased execution order (6 phases)
- Completed plans list
- Summary statistics
- Quick command reference

**Relevance Assessment:**
- **Likely outdated** - claims 38 pending plans, ~4,200 tasks
- Duplicates information available via `status-cli.js` commands
- Manual maintenance burden (must be updated as plans complete)

**Recommendation:** **CONSOLIDATE**
- This is a manual tracking document that duplicates dynamic status
- Information can be generated dynamically via `scan-plans.js` and `status-cli.js`
- Consider:
  1. Auto-generating this document from plan status
  2. Replacing with a simple `/plan:tracker` command
  3. Archiving and relying on CLI for status

## Summary

| File | Recommendation | Action |
|------|---------------|--------|
| VISION.md | KEEP | No action needed |
| ARCHITECTURE.md | KEEP | No action needed |
| ORCHESTRATOR.md | KEEP | No action needed |
| PLAN-EXECUTION-TRACKER.md | CONSOLIDATE | Replace with auto-generated or CLI command |

### Key Findings

1. **Three core docs are essential** and accurately reflect current system state
2. **PLAN-EXECUTION-TRACKER.md** represents maintenance burden and duplication
3. **No files require archival** - all serve active purposes
4. **No obvious obsolescence** - documentation is current with implementation

### Dependencies Identified

- ARCHITECTURE.md references ORCHESTRATOR.md implicitly
- VISION.md references plan-templates and archived implementation plans
- ORCHESTRATOR.md is the authoritative reference for status-cli.js usage
