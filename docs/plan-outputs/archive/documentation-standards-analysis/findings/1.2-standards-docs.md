### 5. analysis-command-selection-guide.md (91 lines)

**Purpose:** Decision matrix helping users choose between `/analyze`, `/review`, and `/audit` commands.

**Content Summary:**
- Command overview table
- Decision matrix for security analysis, code quality, compliance
- Workflow integration examples (pre-commit, pre-merge, pre-release)
- Key differentiators (objective vs subjective, detection vs compliance)

**Relevance Assessment:**
- **Theoretical** - Commands not yet implemented
- **User-facing** - Designed to help users select commands
- **Duplicates** - Similar content in implementation-plan-standards.md

**Recommendation:** **CONSOLIDATE**
- Content is valuable but commands don't exist yet
- Consider merging into implementation-plan-standards.md or user documentation
- Keep in archive until commands are implemented

---

### 6. architecture-command-selection-guide.md (153 lines)

**Purpose:** Decision matrix for `/architect`, `/design`, and `/refactor` commands showing scope hierarchy.

**Content Summary:**
- Command scope hierarchy diagram (system → component → function)
- Quick decision matrix
- Detailed scope definitions
- Workflow examples
- Handoff points between commands
- Key differentiators (strategic vs tactical)

**Relevance Assessment:**
- **Theoretical** - Commands not yet implemented
- **Well-structured** - Clear scope hierarchy
- **User-facing** - Designed for command selection

**Recommendation:** **CONSOLIDATE**
- Same as analysis guide - commands don't exist
- Valuable content for eventual user documentation
- Keep in archive until commands are implemented

---

### 7. documentation-command-selection-guide.md (159 lines)

**Purpose:** Decision matrix for `/document`, `/explain`, `/explore`, and `plan:explain` commands.

**Content Summary:**
- Command overview with audience focus
- Quick decision matrix
- Diátaxis framework alignment for /document
- Explanation structure for /explain
- Persistence and audience comparisons
- Workflow examples
- Command handoffs

**Relevance Assessment:**
- **Partially theoretical** - /explore and plan:explain exist, /document and /explain don't
- **Framework-aligned** - Uses Diátaxis documentation framework
- **User-facing** - Designed for command selection

**Recommendation:** **CONSOLIDATE**
- Split content - keep /explore and plan:explain references active
- Archive /document and /explain sections until implemented
- Consider merging active portions into user documentation

---

| priority-assignment-matrix.md | **KEEP** | Active planning reference |
| command-configuration-guide.md | **KEEP** | Infrastructure reference |
| analysis-command-selection-guide.md | **CONSOLIDATE** | Theoretical - commands not implemented |
| architecture-command-selection-guide.md | **CONSOLIDATE** | Theoretical - commands not implemented |

## Key Findings

### Actively Used (5 files)
1. **implementation-plan-standards.md** - The authoritative standards document
2. **artifact-type-registry.md** - Artifact type definitions
3. **subcommand-naming-reference.md** - Command/subcommand index
4. **priority-assignment-matrix.md** - Execution order reference
5. **command-configuration-guide.md** - Configuration architecture

### Theoretical/Future (4 files)
The four "*-command-selection-guide.md" files document commands that haven't been implemented yet:
- analysis-command-selection-guide.md
- architecture-command-selection-guide.md
- documentation-command-selection-guide.md
- quality-verification-command-selection-guide.md

**Recommended action:** Archive these until their respective commands are implemented, or consolidate into a single "future-commands-guide.md" reference.

### Standards Hierarchy

```
implementation-plan-standards.md (authoritative)
├── artifact-type-registry.md (referenced)
├── subcommand-naming-reference.md (derived)
├── priority-assignment-matrix.md (planning)
└── command-configuration-guide.md (infrastructure)
```

### Missing Standards

1. **No artifact-type-naming-reference.md** - File mentioned in task but doesn't exist
2. **No formal schema validation** - Standards reference schemas but no automated validation
3. **No versioning** - Only implementation-plan-standards.md has version number
