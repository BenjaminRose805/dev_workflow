**Status:** completed
**Started:** 2025-12-25
**Completed:** 2025-12-25

## Summary

Reviewed `docs/standards/PLAN-STANDARDS.md` (Version 1.0, Effective 2025-12-25) to confirm current requirements for plan compliance.

## Key Requirements Identified

### Required Sections (in order)
1. **Title** - `# Implementation Plan: [Name]` or `# Analysis Plan: [Name]`
2. **Overview** - Must contain: Goal, Priority (P0/P1/P2), Created date, Output directory
3. **Dependencies** - Must have: Upstream, Downstream, External Tools subsections
4. **Phase(s)** - At least one `## Phase N: [Title]` with Objective, Tasks, VERIFY
5. **Success Criteria** - Functional and Quality requirements with checkboxes
6. **Risks** - Table with Impact, Likelihood, Mitigation columns

### Phase Requirements
- Each phase must have:
  - `**Objective:**` statement
  - Checklist tasks with proper ID format (N.M or N.M.K)
  - `**VERIFY Phase N:**` section with measurable criteria

### Orchestration Requirements
- All tasks must have explicit file paths
- `[SEQUENTIAL]` annotations required when multiple tasks modify same file
- Tasks must be self-contained (no cross-task references)
- VERIFY criteria must be automatable (commands, not subjective)
- No interactive user prompts that block autonomous execution

### Overview Section Format
```yaml
## Overview

- **Goal:** [One-sentence goal statement]     # REQUIRED
- **Priority:** P0 | P1 | P2                  # REQUIRED
- **Created:** YYYY-MM-DD                      # REQUIRED
- **Output:** docs/plan-outputs/{plan-name}/   # REQUIRED
```

### Task Isolation Requirements
- **Self-contained:** Task has all information needed to execute
- **Idempotent:** Running twice produces same result
- **Isolated:** No hidden dependencies on other tasks in same phase
- **Explicit files:** List files to be modified

- **Version:** 1.0
- **Authority:** PRIMARY - defines all standards for plans, phases, tasks, and orchestration
- **Supersedes:** `docs/standards/implementation-plan-standards.md` (legacy)
