# Task 4.1: Sub-Command Naming Standardization - Findings

## Task Summary
- **Task ID**: 4.1
- **Description**: Standardize Sub-Command Naming
- **Phase**: Phase 4 - Fix Naming Inconsistencies
- **Status**: Completed
- **Completion Date**: 2025-12-24

## Executive Summary

All implementation plans already use the correct colon notation format for sub-commands (`/command:subcommand`). No fixes were required. A comprehensive reference table was created documenting all 193 sub-commands across 15 commands.

## Verification Results

### Plans Analyzed
- **Total implementation plans**: 38
- **Plans with sub-commands**: 33
- **Plans without sub-commands**: 5 (hooks and workflow features)

### Files Without Sub-Commands (Expected)
These files don't define commands, so they correctly have no sub-command references:
1. `implement-artifact-storage-hook.md` - Hook implementation
2. `implement-context-loading-hook.md` - Hook implementation
3. `implement-error-recovery-hooks.md` - Hook implementation
4. `implement-fan-in-fan-out.md` - Workflow feature
5. `implement-workflow-composition.md` - Workflow feature

### Naming Convention Compliance

#### Correct Format (100% Compliance)
All sub-commands use the correct colon notation format:
```
/command:subcommand
```

Examples found:
- `/explore:quick` - Quick exploration mode
- `/analyze:security` - Security analysis
- `/review:pr` - Pull request review
- `/debug:performance` - Performance debugging
- `/implement:component` - Component implementation
- `/model:erd` - Entity-Relationship Diagram
- `/validate:schema` - Schema validation

#### No Issues Found
- No space-separated sub-commands found (`/command subcommand`) ✓
- No missing slash prefixes found (`command:subcommand`) ✓
- All references use lowercase ✓
- Multi-word sub-commands use hyphens correctly (e.g., `/deploy:blue-green`) ✓

## Sub-Command Inventory

### Summary Statistics
- **Total unique sub-commands**: 193
- **Total commands with sub-commands**: 15
- **Average sub-commands per command**: 12.9

### Commands by Sub-Command Count

| Command | Sub-Commands | Examples |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| `/test` | 10 | unit, integration, e2e, coverage, snapshot |
| `/validate` | 8 | spec, schema, requirements, contracts, types |
| `/debug` | 8 | error, performance, behavior, test, memory |
| `/document` | 8 | api, user, developer, architecture, changelog |
| `/implement` | 8 | component, api, schema, data, feature |
| `/release` | 10 | prepare, notes, changelog, version, validate |
| `/refactor` | 10 | extract, rename, patterns, types, security |
| `/migrate` | 7 | schema, api, code, config, data |
| `/analyze` | 7 | security, performance, quality, dependencies |
| `/review` | 7 | pr, diff, file, commit, standards |
| `/architect` | 6 | system, components, data, deployment, adr |
| `/audit` | 8 | security, secrets, dependencies, compliance |
| `/brainstorm` | 6 | solutions, architecture, names, features |
| `/deploy` | 9 | app, preview, promote, rollback, verify |
| `/design` | 6 | component, api, ui, data, state |
| `/document` | 8 | api, user, developer, architecture, changelog |
| `/explain` | 7 | code, architecture, pattern, decision, flow |
| `/explore` | 6 | quick, deep, architecture, patterns, dependencies |
| `/fix` | 8 | bug, security, performance, test, data |
| `/model` | 7 | erd, schema, domain, orm, migration |
| `/research` | 4 | technology, patterns, security, performance |
| `/spec` | 5 | api, schema, graphql, events, data |
| `/workflow` | 2 | create, run |

### Most Common Sub-Command Names

| Sub-Command | Used By Commands | Description |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| `security` | analyze, audit, debug, fix, refactor, research, review | Security-focused operations |
| `performance` | analyze, debug, fix, refactor, research, review | Performance-focused operations |
| `api` | design, document, explain, implement, migrate, spec | API-related operations |
| `schema` | implement, migrate, model, spec, validate | Schema-related operations |
| `test` | analyze, debug, fix, refactor, test | Testing-related operations |

## Deliverables Created

### Reference Documentation
Created comprehensive reference table at:
- **Location**: `/home/benjamin/tools/dev_workflow/docs/standards/subcommand-naming-reference.md`
- **Contents**:
  - Complete sub-command listing by command
  - Naming conventions and standards
  - Common sub-command patterns
  - Usage examples
  - Related documentation links

### Table Structure
The reference table includes:
1. Standard format specification
2. Complete sub-command listings organized by command
3. Purpose/description for each sub-command
4. Naming conventions and best practices
5. Common patterns across commands

## Recommendations

### Maintain Consistency
1. **Continue using colon notation**: Always use `/command:subcommand` format
2. **Follow naming patterns**: Use established sub-command names (security, performance, etc.) consistently
3. **Update reference table**: When adding new sub-commands, update the reference table

### Quality Assurance
1. **Pre-commit checks**: Consider adding linting to validate sub-command format
2. **Template updates**: Ensure plan templates reference the colon notation standard
3. **Documentation**: Link to reference table in new plan documentation

### Future Enhancements
1. **Automated validation**: Create script to verify sub-command naming in plans
2. **Alias support**: Consider adding aliases for commonly used sub-commands
3. **Completion**: Generate shell completion based on reference table

## Conclusion

All implementation plans already follow the correct sub-command naming standard. The colon notation format (`/command:subcommand`) is used consistently across all 33 plans that define commands with sub-commands. No remediation was required.

The comprehensive reference table provides a single source of truth for all 193 sub-commands, organized by command, with clear descriptions and examples.
