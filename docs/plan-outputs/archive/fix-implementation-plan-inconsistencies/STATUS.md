# Plan Status: Fix Implementation Plan Inconsistencies

**Plan:** `docs/plans/fix-implementation-plan-inconsistencies.md`

**Started:** 2025-12-23

**Status:** Not Started

---

## Context

The implementation plans (`docs/plans/implement-*.md`) define how to build new command groups. Each plan's deliverable is command files in `.claude/commands/{group}/`.

**Current state:** Only `/plan:*` commands exist. The 37 implementation plans will create new command groups like `/explore:*`, `/clarify:*`, `/test:*`, etc.

**This fix plan:** Standardizes the 37 implementation plans so they are consistent before execution.
