# Task 5.2: Test Branch Switching Between Plans

## Test Summary

| Test | Description | Result |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Create plan A branch | PASS |
| 2 | Create plan B branch | PASS |
| 3 | Switch back to plan A | PASS |
| 4 | Verify both branches exist | PASS |
| 5 | Switch to plan B again | PASS |
| 6 | Verify status-cli shows correct branch | PASS |
| 7 | Make commit on plan B | PASS |
| 8 | Switch to plan A and make commit | PASS |
| 9 | Verify commit counts are independent | PASS |
| 10 | Each branch has its own file | PASS |

## Test Outputs

### Test 1-5: Branch Creation and Switching
```
=== Test 1: Create plan A branch ===
plan/test-plan-a

=== Test 2: Create plan B branch ===
plan/test-plan-b

=== Test 3: Switch back to plan A ===
Switched to branch 'plan/test-plan-a'

=== Test 4: Verify both branches exist ===
* plan/test-plan-a
  plan/test-plan-b

=== Test 5: Switch to plan B again ===
Switched to branch 'plan/test-plan-b'
```

### Test 6: Status CLI Shows Correct Branch
```
"plan/test-plan-b"
```

### Test 7-8: Independent Commits
```
[plan/test-plan-b 1dfca58] test: plan B commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 test-plan-b-file.txt

[plan/test-plan-a 6909aeb] test: plan A commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 test-plan-a-file.txt
```

### Test 9: Commit Counts Are Independent
```
On plan A branch:
1

On plan B branch:
1
```

Each branch correctly shows 1 commit ahead of master, despite both starting from the same point.

### Test 10: Each Branch Has Its Own File
```
Plan A files:
test-plan-a-file.txt

Plan B files:
test-plan-b-file.txt
```

Files are isolated to their respective branches as expected.

## Cleanup

Test branches `plan/test-plan-a` and `plan/test-plan-b` were deleted after testing.

## Conclusion

Branch switching between plans works correctly:
- Branches can be created and switched between seamlessly
- Commits on each branch are independent
- File changes are isolated to their respective branches
- status-cli correctly reports the current branch
