# Task 2.5: Sequential Batching Verification

## Findings

The orchestrator logs confirm that tasks are being batched one at a time when they have sequential constraints.

### Evidence from `orchestrator.log`:

```
10:32:37 [INFO] Task 2.2 held back (sequential with 2.1)
10:32:37 [INFO] Task 2.3 held back (sequential with 2.1)
10:32:37 [INFO] Task 2.4 held back (sequential with 2.1)
10:32:37 [INFO] Filtered 5 tasks to 2 (respecting sequential constraints)
```

### Analysis

1. **Sequential Detection**: The orchestrator correctly identified that tasks 2.1-2.4 are part of a sequential group
2. **Proper Filtering**: Tasks 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 were held back while 2.1 was pending
3. **Constraint Enforcement**: The message "Filtered 5 tasks to 2 (respecting sequential constraints)" shows the constraint system is actively limiting batch sizes

## Conclusion

**PASSED**: The sequential constraint annotation `[SEQUENTIAL]` is correctly flowing through the pipeline and the orchestrator is properly batching tasks one at a time for the sequential group 2.1-2.4.
