2. **Plan Editing** - Direct file manipulation
3. **Git Integration** - Auto-commit, branch management
4. **Worktree Management** - Create/remove worktrees
5. **Task Splitting** - `/plan:split` for decomposition
6. **Task Explanation** - `/plan:explain` for context
7. **Task Verification** - `/plan:verify` for validation
8. **Daemon Mode** - Background execution
9. **Batch Execution** - Parallel task batches
10. **Plan Lifecycle** - Archive, rollback, cleanup, abandon
11. **Multi-Plan Monitor** - Aggregate view across plans

## Feature Gap Analysis

### High Priority Gaps (Dashboard Missing Critical Features)

| Feature | Impact | Recommendation |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Plan creation | Cannot create plans from dashboard | Add creation wizard or link to CLI |
| Task explanation | Cannot understand task context | Add "Explain" action button |
| Git integration | No visibility into commits | Add commit history view |
| Worktree management | Cannot manage worktrees | Add worktree panel |

### Medium Priority Gaps

| Feature | Impact | Recommendation |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Plan editing | Must use external editor | Could add monaco editor |
| Daemon mode | Cannot detach dashboard | Not critical for web UI |
| Batch execution | Limited to sequential | Could add batch mode toggle |
| Plan archival | Must use CLI for cleanup | Add archive action |

### Low Priority Gaps

| Feature | Impact | Recommendation |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Plan templates | Must use CLI | Nice-to-have |
| Multi-plan monitor | Dashboard shows all plans | Already has grid view |
| Plan validation | Server validates on load | Automatic |

## Conclusion

The dashboard provides a **superior viewing experience** for plan status, task progress, and activity monitoring. However, it lacks **authoring and lifecycle management** capabilities that the CLI provides.

**Migration Strategy:**
- Keep dashboard as the primary **monitoring and control** interface
- CLI remains essential for **plan creation, editing, and advanced operations**
- API server bridges the two, no code migration needed

**Estimated Feature Parity for Monitoring-Only Dashboard:** ~80%
**Estimated Feature Parity for Full Plan Management:** ~40%
