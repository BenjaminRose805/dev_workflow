# Task 1.3: Create Standards Document - Findings

**Completed:** 2025-12-23

## Summary

Created comprehensive `docs/standards/implementation-plan-standards.md` document that defines all naming conventions, priority levels, quality targets, and artifact schemas for implementation plans.

---

## Deliverables

### Created Files
- `docs/standards/implementation-plan-standards.md` (new file, ~450 lines)

---

## Standards Documented

### 1. Naming Conventions

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Sub-commands | Colon notation | `/explore:quick` |
| Models | Short form | `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku` |
| Artifacts | kebab-case | `validation-report` |
| Severity | lowercase | `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info` |
| Files | kebab-case | `implement-explore-command.md` |

### 2. Priority Levels

- **P0 (Critical Path):** Foundation commands, no dependencies, many downstream consumers
- **P1 (Important):** Core workflow commands, depends on P0
- **P2 (Enhancement):** Nice-to-have features, can be deferred

### 3. Quality Targets

| Target | Standard | Critical |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Test coverage | > 85% | > 95% |
| Critical issues | 0 | 0 |
| High issues | ≤ 5 | 0 |

### 4. Quality Gate Schema

```yaml
gates:
  critical: 0
  high: 5
  medium: 20
  low: unlimited
  coverage: 85
```

### 5. Performance Categories

| Category | Target | Use Case |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Quick | < 30s | Simple operations |
| Standard | < 2min | Typical operations |
| Deep | < 10min | Comprehensive analysis |
| Extended | < 30min | Batch processing |

### 6. Model Selection Guidelines

- **haiku:** Simple formatting, listing tasks
- **sonnet:** Default for most tasks
- **opus:** Complex reasoning, architecture decisions

### 7. ADR Template

Included complete decision log template for architectural decisions.

## Related Tasks

This task completes Phase 1 preparation. The standards document will be used to:
- Validate plans in Phase 10
- Guide creation of missing plans in Phase 2
- Inform structural fixes in Phases 3-9
