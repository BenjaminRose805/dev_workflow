# Task 7.6: Review plans without status tracking

## Summary

Reviewed 3 plans without status.json tracking to determine if they should be archived.

## Analysis

### 1. plan-system-analysis.md

**Status:** ARCHIVE

**Rationale:**
- All 23 inline checkboxes are marked complete (`[x]`)
- This was an analysis plan that produced findings used to create `output-separation-implementation.md`
- The output-separation-implementation plan is already archived (completed)
- No separate status.json exists because the plan used inline checkboxes (pre-output-separation era)

**Action:** Archived to `docs/plans/archive/`

### 2. high-priority-fixes.md

**Status:** KEEP (not superseded)

**Rationale:**
- Depends on `critical-fixes.md` which is now archived (completed)
- Contains 57 high-severity items that are still valid work items:
  - 10 High Bugs (memory leaks, race conditions)
  - 15 High DRY Violations (350+ LOC)
  - 28 High Inconsistencies
  - 4 High Unused Code items
- Zero tasks have been started
- Plan is still relevant - should be executed when resources allow

**Action:** None - plan remains in active plans directory

### 3. medium-priority-fixes.md

**Status:** KEEP (not superseded)

**Rationale:**
- Depends on `high-priority-fixes.md` (pending) and `critical-fixes.md` (archived/complete)
- Contains 91 medium/low severity items that are still valid work items
- Zero tasks have been started
- Plan is the "final cleanup plan in the series" - still relevant

**Action:** None - plan remains in active plans directory

## Conclusion

Only `plan-system-analysis.md` was archived. The high and medium priority fix plans remain active as they contain valid pending work items that were never superseded.
