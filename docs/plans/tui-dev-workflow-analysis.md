# Analysis Plan: TUI Dev Workflow Analysis

## Overview
- **Target:** Terminal TUI tools (glow, yazi, micro, lazygit, etc.)
- **Focus:** Features, functionality, and integration opportunities
- **Created:** 2025-12-24
- **Output:** `docs/plan-outputs/tui-dev-workflow-analysis/`

> Task findings are written to the `findings/` subdirectory. Use `/plan:status` to view progress.

## Phase 1: Discovery
- [ ] 1.1 Inventory current TUI tools installed and their versions
- [ ] 1.2 Document current configuration for each tool (yazi, micro, glow, etc.)
- [ ] 1.3 Map existing integrations between tools
- [ ] 1.4 Identify workflow gaps and pain points
- [ ] **VERIFY 1**: Discovery findings documented

## Phase 2: Deep Analysis
- [ ] 2.1 Analyze yazi: plugins, keybindings, preview capabilities
- [ ] 2.2 Analyze micro: plugins, LSP support, syntax highlighting
- [ ] 2.3 Analyze glow: rendering options, integration potential
- [ ] 2.4 Analyze git workflow tools (lazygit, git integrations)
- [ ] 2.5 Analyze shell/terminal setup (zsh, tmux, etc.)
- [ ] 2.6 Categorize findings by priority (HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW)
- [ ] **VERIFY 2**: All tools analyzed with findings

## Phase 3: Synthesis
- [ ] 3.1 Identify high-value missing features per tool
- [ ] 3.2 Find integration opportunities between tools
- [ ] 3.3 Research available plugins/extensions to fill gaps
- [ ] 3.4 Propose workflow improvements
- [ ] 3.5 Create prioritized enhancement roadmap
- [ ] **VERIFY 3**: Recommendations complete

## Phase 4: Implementation Planning
- [ ] 4.1 List quick wins (easy to implement, high value)
- [ ] 4.2 Document configuration changes needed
- [ ] 4.3 Identify plugins to install
- [ ] 4.4 Create implementation checklist
- [ ] **VERIFY 4**: Actionable implementation plan ready

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All TUI tools inventoried and analyzed
- [ ] Integration opportunities identified
- [ ] Prioritized list of enhancements created
- [ ] Implementation steps documented in `findings/`
