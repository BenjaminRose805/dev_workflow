# Create Plan: {{plan_name}}

## Overview
- **Objective:** {{objective}}
- **Scope:** {{scope}}
- **Created:** {{date}}

## Phase 1: Requirements Gathering
- [ ] Clarify the goal and success criteria
- [ ] Identify stakeholders and constraints
- [ ] Define scope boundaries (what's in/out)
- [ ] Gather context from existing code/docs

**Requirements:**
<!-- List requirements here -->

**Constraints:**
<!-- List constraints here -->

**Out of Scope:**
<!-- Explicitly exclude things -->

## Phase 2: Research & Analysis
- [ ] Explore relevant parts of codebase
- [ ] Identify existing patterns to follow
- [ ] Research similar implementations
- [ ] Identify risks and dependencies

**Key Findings:**
<!-- Research findings -->

**Patterns to Follow:**
<!-- Existing patterns in the codebase -->

**Dependencies:**
<!-- External dependencies or blockers -->

## Phase 3: Plan Design
- [ ] Break objective into phases
- [ ] Break phases into concrete tasks
- [ ] Order tasks by dependency
- [ ] Add verification steps
- [ ] Define success criteria

**Draft Structure:**
<!-- Outline the plan structure -->

## Phase 4: Plan Writing
- [ ] Write overview section
- [ ] Detail each phase with tasks
- [ ] Add checkboxes for all actionable items
- [ ] Include verification/validation phase
- [ ] Define clear success criteria

**Output Location:** `docs/plans/{{plan_filename}}.md`

## Phase 5: Plan Review
- [ ] Review for completeness
- [ ] Check task granularity (not too big, not too small)
- [ ] Verify phases are in logical order
- [ ] Ensure success criteria are measurable

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Plan has clear objective
- [ ] Phases are logical and sequential
- [ ] Tasks are actionable (start with verb)
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Plan can be executed with `/plan:implement`
